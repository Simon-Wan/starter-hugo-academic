I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in [YaoClass](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University.

My  primary  research  interest  is  to  build  AI  systems  that  can  better  understand  human 
intentions and take actions in the physical world for humans and for themselves. 

I hope to improve  current  machine  intelligence  by  drawing  inspiration  from  findings  in  cognitive 
science,  especially  on  how  humans  represent  information  in  their  minds  and  how  they 
deliver internal ideas.
